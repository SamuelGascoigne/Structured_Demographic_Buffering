# Structured_Demographic_Buffering

This repository stores the code for the structured demographic buffering project. These scripts set-up integral projection models (IPMs) and run simulations to explore the relationship(s) between environment, population and vital rate structure on buffering (i.e., the summation of stochastic elasticities of lambda with respect to vital rate variance).
